# Day 5: Security and Networking Concepts – Enhanced Notes

## 1. Micro USB Port

A **Micro USB port** is a widely used physical connector for charging devices and transferring data, especially in older electronics.

  <br/><sup><i>Micro USB Type-B connector (commonly found on smartphones and IoT devices)</i></sup>
</div>

**Key Points:**
- Found in older smartphones, embedded boards (e.g., older Raspberry Pi), IoT devices, cameras.
- Gradually replaced by USB-C in modern devices.
- Supports both power delivery and data transfer.

## 2. Data Exploitation

**Data exploitation** is the act of using vulnerabilities or weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Examples:**
- Guessing or cracking weak passwords.
- Exploiting software bugs (e.g., buffer overflows).
- Injecting malicious code (SQL injection, XSS).

**Goals:**
- Steal confidential data.
- Modify or destroy information.
- Gain control over systems.

**Prevention Tips:**
- Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
- Regularly update and patch software.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

---

## 3. SSH (Secure Shell)

**SSH** is a secure protocol for remote communication between devices over a network.

  <br/><sup><i>SSH enables secure remote logins and encrypted file transfers</i></sup>
</div>

**Key Uses:**
- Remote login to Linux/Unix servers.
- Secure file transfer (SCP, SFTP).
- Tunneling network traffic.

**Security Features:**
- Encrypts all transmitted data.
- Uses key-based or password authentication.
- Prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 4. Low Privilege User

A **low privilege user** account has minimal access rights:

- Can perform basic, non-administrative tasks.
- Cannot install software or change critical system settings.
- Reduces risk if account is breached (limits damage).

**Best Practice:** Always use the lowest privilege necessary for a task.

---

## 5. Root User

The **root user** (or "superuser") has complete control over a system:

- Can read, modify, or delete any file.
- Install/uninstall software, change all configurations.
- **Warning:** Misusing root access can break the system or compromise security.


---

## 6. Privilege Escalation

**Privilege escalation** refers to gaining higher access than initially authorized.

| Type       | Description                                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vertical**   | Gaining admin/root privileges from a normal user account.          |
| **Horizontal** | Accessing another user’s account at the same privilege level.      |

**Common Methods:**
- Exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities.
- Misconfigured permissions.
- Weak or default credentials.

**Prevention:**
- Keep systems updated.
- Apply the principle of least privilege.
- Use strong, unique passwords.

---

## 7. Bash Script

A **Bash script** is a text file containing a sequence of commands for automating tasks on Linux/Unix.

**Features:**
- File extension: `.sh`
- Used for automation, backups, server maintenance, and more.
- Can include logic (if, loops), variables, and functions.

**Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## 8. SOC (Security Operations Center)

A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized facility/team that monitors, detects, and responds to cybersecurity threats.

  <br/><sup><i>Modern SOCs use advanced tools for threat detection and response</i></sup>
</div>

**Key Functions:**
- Real-time threat monitoring.
- Incident detection and response.
- Vulnerability management and reporting.
- Digital forensics and investigation.

**Goal:**  
Protect the organization’s IT systems and data from cyber-attacks.

|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Micro USB Port**    | Physical connector for charging/data on older devices        |
| **Data Exploitation** | Unauthorized use of weaknesses to access/control data        |

| **Root User**         | Superuser with unrestricted access to all system resources   |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Gaining higher access than intended                        |
| **Bash Script**       | Automates Linux/Unix tasks via command sequences             |
| **SOC**               | Team/facility for monitoring and responding to cyber threats |
